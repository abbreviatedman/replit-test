### Guidelines

* If a question asks you to define a variable in terms of another variable, then do... exactly that. If `x = 2`, and you're asked to make `y` be 1 more than `x`, then the correct answer is to define `y` as `x + 1`, _not_ as `3`.

### Numbers

* Create a variable called `dollars` that holds the number 50.

* Create a variable called `hamburgerPrice` that holds a number in the range 1-10, inclusive.
* Create a variable called `numberOfHamburgers` that holds a number in the range 1-10, inclusive.
* Create a variable called `dollarsSpent` and define it in terms of `hamburgerPrice` and `numberOfHamburgers` such that it is the two values multiplied by each other.
* Create a variable called `newDollars` and define it in terms of `dollars` and `dollarsSpent` such that it is the value of `dollars` minus the value of `dollarsSpent`.

### Strings
* Create a variable called `firstName` that holds your first name (or any non-empty string).
* Create a variable called `lastName` thta holds your last name (or any non-empty string).
* Create a variable called `fullName` and define it in terms of `firstName` and `lastName` such that it is the first, followed by a space, followed by the second.
* Create a variable called `school` that holds
